Printer Troubleshooting:
Common Symptoms:
 - Printer offline / not found
 - Stuck print queue
 - Poor print quality (streaks, faded text)

Quick Fix Checklist:

Physical Checks:
- Verify power and network/USB cables.
- Ensure the printer is on the same Wi-Fi/VLAN as the user’s device.

Queue & Driver:

In a PowerShell Script run the following to reset the Spooler
# Windows – clear queue
net stop spooler
del %systemroot%\System32\spool\PRINTERS\* /Q
net start spooler

Update or reinstall the printer driver.

Test Print:
- From OS printer settings, print a test page.
 - If still failing, try a different user profile or device to isolate.

Hardware:
Check toner/ink levels, paper jams, and clean rollers if output is streaked.
