#  IT Help Desk Portfolio

This repository is my learning journey into IT Support & Help Desk fundamentals.  
It serves as both a **portfolio** of hands-on projects and a **knowledge base** I‚Äôve built while studying and practicing.  

I‚Äôm pursuing opportunities within the IT career Sphere and currently hold a Bachelors in Computer Science and am currently working on my Masters in Information Technology This repo is meant to demonstrate:
- Technical troubleshooting
- Documentation & knowledge sharing
- Scripting & automation
- Customer service‚Äìoriented IT problem solving

As well as showcase my desire for continued learning and drive.
I would also like to state here my intent to pursue Cloud Engineering roles as I hopefully progress throughout my career.
