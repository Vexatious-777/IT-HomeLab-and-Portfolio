# 💻 IT Help Desk Portfolio — Alexander Griffith

Welcome!  
This repository is my learning journey into IT Support & Help Desk fundamentals.  
It serves as both a **portfolio** of hands-on projects and a **knowledge base** I’ve built while studying and practicing.  

I’m pursuing opportunities in IT Support, Desktop Support, and Help Desk roles. This repo is meant to demonstrate:
- Technical troubleshooting
- Documentation & knowledge sharing
- Scripting & automation
- Customer service–oriented IT problem solving
